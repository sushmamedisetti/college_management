                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;College Management System, or CMS, is a 
                web-based platform that helps schools and colleges take students problem data online for 
                easier management and better clarity. That's at its most basic.This website is able to 
                display the online data to the admins, who can view and solve problems faced by the students
                 so that it can be easily accessed by teachers , students, and administrators. That includes
                  student personal problems,management,and plenty more.</br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To be clear, it's an CMS we're talking 
                about here, which can also break down into a Student Management System (SMS), Student 
                Information College Maintaince System, or Student Records System (SRS) - all created to 
                help keep records digitally.

This Website can be used within a college for student data or information on the college as a whole.
 But the platforms can also be used to manage multiple institutions college wise, say, to get a clearer
  view of how college compare on very specific metrics.
